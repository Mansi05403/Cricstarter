            Batting is not just about hitting boundaries, there is a lot to
            learn in it. To become a good batsman itâ€™s quite important to
            improve pace bowling basics. In this article, we will be teaching
            you some shear basics of batting against pace bowling, if you are
            starting it from scratch as a batsman.

              An outswinger is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is
              bowled by swing bowlers.
              <span class="span"
                >An outswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the
                seam at an angle and the first two fingers running along either
                side of the seam.</span
              >
            </p>
            <div class="para-gap">
              <p>
                Once the ball has worn and been polished so that one side is
                rougher than the other, the rough side is placed on the left.
                When the bowler delivers the ball, he angles the seam so that it
                points slightly to the left as well, and releases the ball
                rotating about a vertical axis with the seam along the
                rotational axis. The angle of the seam to the direction of
                motion produces an aerofoil effect as the ball moves through the
                air, pushing it to the left. This is enhanced by differential
                air pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth
                surfaces, which also tends to push the ball to the left. The
                result is that the ball curves, or swings to the left.
                <span class="span"
                  >From a right-handed batsman's point of view, the swing is
                  away from his body towards his right, i.e. towards the off
                  side. This swing away from the body is the source of the name
                  outswinger.</span

              An inswinger is a type of delivery of the ball in the sport of
              cricket.It is bowled by swing bowlers.
              <span class="span">
                An inswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam
                vertical and the first two fingers slightly across the seam so
                that it is angled a little to the leg side.
              </span>
            </p>
            <div class="para-gap">
              Inswing can be bowled from side-on, mid-way or chest on positions.
              But bowlers usually tend to pitch it in the good length spot or up
              to the batsman. When the bowler delivers the ball, he angles the
              seam so that it points slightly to the leg side. To help achieve
              this position the bowling arm should be near vertical, brushing
              close to the ear. At release the wrist should remain cocked so as
              to help impart backspin along the orientation of the seam. The
              angle of the seam to the direction of motion produces an aerofoil
              effect as the ball moves through the air, pushing it to the leg
              side. This is enhanced by differential air pressure caused by
              movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces, which also
              tends to push the ball to the leg side. The result is that the
              ball curves, or swings in to the batsman.
              <span class="span"
                >Inswingers are not considered to be as difficult for a
                right-handed batsman to play as an outswinger. This is because
                the ball moves in towards his body.</span

              A Bouncer is a type of delivery of the ball in the sport of
              cricket.
              <span class="span">
                a bouncer (or bumper) is a short-pitched delivery, usually
                bowled by a fast bowler, which bounces once and then reaches the
                batsman at head-height.</span
              >
            </p>
            <div class="para-gap">
              Bouncers are used to drive the batsman back on to his back foot if
              he has been freely playing front foot scoring shots, such as
              drives. To this end, bouncers are usually directed more or less at
              the line of the batsman's body. Aiming at the batsman is legal
              provided the ball bounces on the pitch; or upon reaching the
              batsman, the ball is below the batsman's waist.
              <span class="span">
                Aiming at the batsman's head without bouncing on the pitch,
                known as a beamer, is illegal.</span

              A yorker is a full-length delivery which is pitched in front of a
              batsmanâ€™s feet by a bowler; not necessarily by a fast bowler.
              <span class="span">
                A well-executed yorker is when it is aimed at a playerâ€™s shoes,
                and it bounces at his feet only. If directed well, it is by a
                distance the most difficult ball to play for a batsman.</span
              >
            </p>
            <div class="para-gap">
              it is equally tough for a bowler to pitch a right yorker than for
              a batsman to play it. In the simplest of terms, you, as a bowler,
              has to deliver the ball late to ensure it goes far enough to reach
              a batsmanâ€™s feet. Though general advice would be to say the hand
              should be pointing directly vertical; there have been bowlers who
              have defied such a notion.
              <span class="span">
                Perhaps the best way of delivering it is to drive your bowling
                shoulder to the target, and if directed rightly, it should be
                pacey and fuller. However, it requires a lot of net sessions to
                become a specialist in bowling yorkers.</span

              AB de Villiers or popularly called ABD by the fans is a South
              African batsman famous for his 360-degree style of play. Since his
              debut in 2004, the pretorian has risen to gargantuan heights with
              his sheer raw talent and an incredible array of shots that has
              befuddled the fans over the years.AB de Villiers has the ability
              to increase his batting strike rate in any situation, unlike most
              players in the world. Apart from attacking the bowler, he is also
              known for the defensive technique in Test Cricket. In 2015, AB De
              Villers scored 43 runs in 297 balls at the strike rate of 14.05 in
              Tests.

              Virat Kohli is the only Indian batsman who got 890 rating points
              in the ICC ODI ranking. Previously Sachin Tendulkar got the best
              rating of 887 in 1998. Virat Kolhi has the record of having the
              highest ICC rating points (937) in the ICC Player Rankings for
              Test Batsmen. Virat Kohli scored seven double centuries as a
              captain in test matches. He surpassed Cricket legend Brian Lara,
              who had five double centuries as a test captain. Virat Kohli
              became the first player to hit consecutive 3 centuries in against
              two opponents (West Indies & Sri Lanka). Kohli is the most
              successful Indian ODI captain. Virat Kohli scored more than 20,000
              runs at an average of over 50 in all formats -Test matches, One
              Day Internationals, and T-20 matches.

              Seeing his cool captaincy skills for the T20 World Championship in
              2007 held in South Africa, he was awarded the captainâ€™s position
              for the one-day international team as well. Within 4 years, he
              brought the World Cup back in India after 28 years in 2011. Since
              then, he has won a lot of accolades across the world. He received
              Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 2007-08. He also received LGâ€™s Peopleâ€™s
